        All of our lessons have a purpose. To have fun and at the same time
        transform the dancing into something great, whether for social dancing
        or competitive dancing.
      </p>
      <p class="lead text-muted text-justify">
        A dance partner is not required for any of these lessons. There is no
        up-front financial commitment, and you only pay for the classes you
        attend.
